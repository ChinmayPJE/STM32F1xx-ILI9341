# STM32F1xx-ILI9341
Attempt to interbreed STM32F1xx HAL, ILI9341 video driver and Adafruit LCD library

The ST already provide several projects like this. This is just little extender, which allow to use ILI9341-based LCD with various STM MCU. 
I tried it with STM32F0 and STM32F1. It was working for me.
